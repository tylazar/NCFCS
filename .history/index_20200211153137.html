					faculty to create a custom curriculum plan to prepare you for

					<h2>Get personalized feedback and advice in each class.</h2>
					<p class="standard-text">New College supports students with
					a passion for learning and a desire to take responsibility
					for their own education. That's why our professors provide
					narrative evaluations rather than letter grades to assess
					your work each term. These discussion-based assessments let
					instructors have a one-on-one conversation with the student
					to identify their strengths and weaknesses and develop a
					plan for future learning.</p>

				<td>
					<h2>Create custom tutorials in collaboration with faculty.</h2>
					<p>Work with faculty members to create your own course in a
					specific area of interest. Past tutorials have included
					hacking, competitive programming, cryptography, and
					thesis-based research, but are limited only by your
					imagination.</p>
